# Semantic Address Routing and Hardware - SARAH

## Introduction
Historically, the meaning of an IP address has been to identify an interface on a network device. Routing protocols have been developed based on the assumption that a destination address has this semantic with routing decisions made on addresses and additional fields in the packet headers. Recent research proposals suggest adding additional semantics within IP addresses to aid routing and define how packets should be handled. This discussion is intended to collect and disseminate research around the impact on routing and hardware of various forms of semantic addressing.
