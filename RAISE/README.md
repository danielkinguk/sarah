# Routing and Addressing in the Internet with Semantic Enhancements (RAISE)
An initial draft proposal for a Proposed Research Group in the IRTF

## Introduction
This subdirectory is a home for proposals to form a new Research Group in the IRTF.
There are two files:
* [Motivation](https://github.com/danielkinguk/sarah/blob/main/RAISE/motivation.md) : This material should be read first as it contains some discussion and background that helps establish the purpose of a Research Group.
* Charter : This **early draft** of a charter is a stake in the ground. It is intended to provide a starting point for discussions of what a charter might look like.
